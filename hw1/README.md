# Crypto Swap Simulator

A Crypto Swap Simulator that allows users to simulate token swaps between ETH, BTC, DAI, USDC, and USDT using various providers.

## Why This Project?

Introduces concepts of cryptocurrency trading, exchange rates, and fee calculations.

## Features

- **Token Support**: ETH, BTC, DAI, USDC, USDT
- **Multiple Providers**: Thorchain, Uniswap V3, 1inch, SushiSwap, Curve Finance
   > Each provider has its own support token, for example: BTC is only supported by Thorchain, and Curve only support stable coin (DAI, USDC, USDT)
- **Real-time Calculations**: Live swap quotes with fees and price impact
- **Mobile-first Design**: Responsive interface optimized for mobile devices
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for better development experience

### Content Structure
The application content is carefully designed to be both functional and educational:

- **Token Selection**: Users learn about different cryptocurrencies and their characteristics
- **Provider Comparison**: Demonstrates how different DeFi protocols offer varying rates and fees
- **Real-time Calculations**: Shows the impact of exchange rates and fees on swap outcomes
- **Interactive Learning**: Users can experiment with different scenarios without financial risk
