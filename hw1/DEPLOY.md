## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If GitHub Pages doesn't work:**
- Make sure you're in the `hw1` folder
- Check that `index.html` is in the root of `hw1`
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to build

**If Netlify doesn't work:**
- Make sure you built the project first (`npm run build`)
- Check that the `dist` folder exists
- Try uploading just the contents of `hw1`

**If Vercel doesn't work:**
- Make sure you're logged in (`vercel login`)
- Check your internet connection
- Try again in a few minutes
